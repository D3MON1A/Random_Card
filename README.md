# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32)  Random Card Dealer CLI

In this project you will learn how to use coding logic to generate random cards.

## Instructions

Create and algorithm that randomly builds a random card every time it runs:

1. Every time the algorithm runs a new random card needs to show on the console.
2. The card must have one of the possible suites: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamons.
3. The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).

In the end, the project needs to look similar to [this demo](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=random-card-cli-python&preview).

### Hints

- You can use emoji for the card suites: `♡ ♧ ♤ ♢`
